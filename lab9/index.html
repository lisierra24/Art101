		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Once again, I had a challenging time linking my JavaScript
			file onto my .html extension. This time it was mostly due
			to using a wrong element. Little tidious errors that I overlook
		usually make me take longer on some of the steps.</p>
		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> I did not have a big issue/problem with the lab, however, some
			of the instructions are a little vague and it was a little difficult to
			follow along. I tried doing the the bonus tasks but everything I was
			trying kept deleting the elements I had put in from task 2.

		<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p>	Breaking down my instructions into small steps was the most challenging.
				 At first I was trying to be as detailed as possible which resulted in long explanations.
				 Besides that adding a picture next to my instructions took me a while to figure out
				 but with the resources offered, I was able to figure it out :)
			</p>
		<h3> Problems </h3>
			<p> Overall the process went smooth and there were minor problems
				along the way. Most of the minor problems had to do with the
				structure for my Lab 4 web, minor details regarding CSS, such as,
				font, header size, and spacing.

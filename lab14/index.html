		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> I did not run into any challenges or issues for this lab. I was able to
			use some of the debugging methods to fix previous labs. Along with the support
			of my partner, he was able to guide me through lab 12 and 13, whcih were the two
			labs I struggled with the most!

		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> As mentioned previously, I did not run into many problems for this lab.
			I just need practice with JQuery and JavaScript to be comfortable with the
			whole programming process.

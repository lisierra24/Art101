		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> For lab six, there were not many challenges. Since lab five
			made the foundation for lab six all I had to focus on was listing
			the arrays and objects.
		</P>
		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> I ran into silly mistakes throughout the lab. I had to keep
			reminding myself the different structures when use when listing
			arrays and objects. I was used to the semi colons and curly brackets, so
			I had to go back a fix a couple small errors.

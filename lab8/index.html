		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> The most challenging part on this lab was understanding how
				functions are written down and what everything in that
				function means. I had to review the lecture to refresh
				my memory. Other than that, the bonuses were challenging to
				get done.

		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p>	Lab seven did not bring many problems. I was able to create
			the files from start without a problem.

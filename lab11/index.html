		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Some of the challeges I encountered had
			to do with Task 3: "Toggle a class special within the "div" of the section".
			At first I was not sure what I was being asked
			for, eventually Brock guided us in our section.
			</p>

	<div id="problems">
		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> One problem I ran into was in my html page.
			I did not use the right tag ("div") to label my buttons
		  so it became a little confusing to call my buttons
			from my .js file.
		</p>

	<div id="results">
    <h4> Results </h4>
		<p> Click the buttons!!!</p>

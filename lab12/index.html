		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Some of the challeges I encountered had
			to do with the "remainder" in my JavaScript. Once I would open inspect,
			I would get an error to "can't find variable: remainder." It was difficult
			to approach this error since I was not sure how to fix it. With lab 14 I was
			able to debug this label and fix it!

		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> I basically just ran into issues with my JavaScript. There were a few
			variables that would not run, I decided to turn in what I have and ask for
			guidance from professors/Brock.

			<h2> Challenge </h2>
			<p> Linking my .js extesion file to .html file was challenging. There
				were some quotation marks missing in the code which would lead to errors.
			</P>
			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p> Moreover, "document.writeln" was misspelled in the extension
				lab.js which disabled the context to upload on the Web. Did not know this
				was my error until 30 minutes after trying to solve the issue.

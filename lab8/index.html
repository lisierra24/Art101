		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Linking my javascript file to the .html extension was challenging.
			For some reason the script code kept turning gray, resutling in all
			my index.html page turning gray as well. I am not sure what caused
			this, however, I just closed and opend atom, everything worked well.
		</p>
		<h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> I had minor issues in this lab. It was mostly understanding how the
			functions work out. Overall, this lab was straighforward and minor mistakes
			such as spelling were the only issues.
